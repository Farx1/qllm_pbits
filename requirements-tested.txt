# Tested Versions (NOT a complete lock file with transitive dependencies)
#
# These are the top-level package versions that were validated on Windows 11
# with Python 3.11.9 on January 5, 2026.
#
# To generate a complete lock file with all transitive dependencies and hashes:
#   pip install pip-tools
#   pip-compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock --generate-hashes
#
# Or using uv (faster):
#   pip install uv
#   uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
#
